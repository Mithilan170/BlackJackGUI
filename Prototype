print('This is blackjack. Rules are simple whoever has the biggest sum of the cards at the end wins. Unless someone gets 21 / blackjack or goes over 21 (bust). Bust is when a player goes over 21 and the lose. Once it is your turn you can choose to hit or stand, if you hit you get another card, if you stand it becomes the other persons turn. Your goal is to get the closest number to 21 without going over it. The game uses no suit cards. The values of the face cards are a Jack = 10, Queen = 10, King = 10, Ace = 11 or 1 whatever works the best. ')
